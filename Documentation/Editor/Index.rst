As editor you can set an animation to your content elements if you go to the **Animation** tab.

The screenshot below shows you how to set a animation. You have the possibility to set the animation speed and the delay of that content element as well individually.

.. tip::

   Please look at your animation in the frontend to guarantee a nice look an feel for your users if they scroll your page!

   If any element is animated in a different direction it can be very disturbing.
